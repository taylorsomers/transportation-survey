# Transportation Survey

  ### By Taylor Somers

## Description

  A website to show my working knowledge of arrays and loops in jQuery and JavaScript up to this point in the Epicodus class. It takes the form of a survey that allows the user to input all means of transportation they use for both work and non-work purposes, and lists the modes of transportation in those separate categories once the information is submitted by the user.
